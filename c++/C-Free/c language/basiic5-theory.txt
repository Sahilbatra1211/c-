int-2bytes
	int a;
	scanf("%d",&a);

float-4 bytes
	float b;
	scanf("%f%,&f)
	
double 4 bytes
		more precise than float
		double c;
		scanf("%e",&c);
char 1 byte
		char c;
		scanf("%c",&c);
		
ascii code- A-Z=65-90
			a-z=97-122
			0-10=48-57
			(c) The following statements would work

int a, b, c, d ;
a = b = c = 10 ;
However, the following statement would not work
int a = b = c = d = 10 ;

Integer and Float Conversions
In order to effectively develop C programs, it will be necessary to
understand the rules that are used for the implicit conversion of
floating point and integer values in C. These are mentioned below.
Note them carefully.
(a)An arithmetic operation between an integer and integer
always yields an integer result.
An operation between a real and real always yields a real
result.
(b)An operation between an integer and real always yields a real
result. In this operation the integer is first promoted to a real
and then the operation is performed. Hence the result is real.
(c)I think a few practical examples shown in the following figure
would put the issue beyond doubt.
Operation Result Operation Result



5 / 2= 2	 2 / 5= 0
5.0 / 2= 2.5	 2.0 / 5 =0.4
5 / 2.0= 2.5	 2 / 5.0= 0.4
5.0 / 2.0= 2.5	 2.0 / 5.0 =0.4
