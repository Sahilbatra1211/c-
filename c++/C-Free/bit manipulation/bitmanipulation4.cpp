Simple approach to flip the bits of a number: It can be done by a simple way, just simply subtract the number from the value obtained when all the bits are equal to 1 .
For example:
Number : Given Number
Value  : A number with all bits set in given number.
Flipped number = Value – Number.

Example : 
Number = 23,
Binary form: 10111;
After flipping digits number will be: 01000;
Value: 11111 = 31;
